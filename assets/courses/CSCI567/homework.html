	    <b>Grade:</b> Each assignment is worth 8% of the total grade. They are graded based on correctness, and solutions will be posted soon after the deadline. Copying solutions from any other sources is strictly prohibited and will result in zero grade for that assignment. HW 0 will be assigned at the start of the course. This is to help you get familiar with the submission procedure. 
		
		<p>
		<b>Collaboration:</b> Collaboration is permitted but only at high-level. Each member needs to make a separate submission, where information on collaboration is clearly stated. Standards on academic integrity are strictly enforced.
		
		<p>
		<b>Turn-in:</b> Submit one single PDF file to <a href="https://courses.uscden.net/d2l/login"
		target="_blank">D2L</a>. This can be a scanned copy of your handwritten solutions or generated by softwares such as LaTeX.
		
		<p>
		<b>Late turn-in:</b> You have a total of 3 "late days" for the entire semester, and you can use at most one late day for each written assignment. If your submission is one day late, we will automatically record that one late day has been used, unless you have no late days left, in which case your grade for that assignment will be zero. Any submission more than one day late will result in zero grade as well. Please note that tracking late days is your responsibility, and they are in place of "excused late" submissions, not in addition to.		
		
		<p>
		<b>Re-grading:</b> After each assignment is graded, you have a two-day window to contact the respective graders should you have any re-grading request (regarding <i>factual errors</i> only). You can do so during their office hours or via a private Piazza post. After two days, no re-grading requests will be considered.

		<b>General:</b> Quizzes are open-book, but they are designed in a way so that checking books/notes/Internet/etc. is moot in some sense, and you are better off just spending the time on solving the problems yourself. <b>No collaboration of any kind or consultation from others is allowed. Cheating will result in zero grade.</b> Some sample quizzes will be released and discussed in the discussion sessions.
		
		<p>
		<b>Format:</b> Each quiz is worth 15% of the total grade, and contains several multiple-choice questions as well as general problems (that are similar to the written assignments). We will be using <a href="https://app.crowdmark.com/sign-in/usc" target="_blank">Crowdmark</a>, where you can upload pictures of your handwritten solutions for all problems. No printer is required, but make sure you have a device to take pictures. Also try your best to make sure that your handwriting is recognizable. <b>The quiz timings will be same for all the students irrespective of the time-zones.</b>
		
		<p>
		<b>Logistics:</b>
		The quizzes are in-class, where you will use the same link as the lectures and will be automatically assigned to a breakout room. Each room has one TA/CP to proctor the entire quiz, and you have to <b>turn your camera on</b>. It is your responsibility to make sure that your camera works. If you have any clarification questions during the quiz, make a <b>private post</b> on Piazza and it will be answered shortly.
		
		
		<p>
		<b>Re-grading:</b> Similar to the written assignments, after each exam is graded, you have a two-day window to contact our TAs should you have any re-grading request (regarding <i>factual errors</i> only). You can do so during their office hours or via a private Piazza post. After two days, no re-grading requests will be considered.
		
		<h2 align="center">Programming Project (Due May 3, 2021, 11:59PM, Pacific Time)</h2>
		
		<p>
		<b>General:</b> 
		The programming project is worth 30% of the total grade. It consists of a Kaggle-based group project. The project will be introduced on Feb. 3, 2021, and will have an update due on Mar. 10, 2021.  If you have any questions on the project our TAs and CPs are happy to help you.	<p>
		<b>Due date:</b> Pacific Time. We will be running scripts to track your progress, as a result the deadlines are fixed and no late days are allowed. You should definitely avoid submitting in the last minute to avoid any unexpected issues (e.g. Internet connection lost).
